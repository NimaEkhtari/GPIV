Easy To-Do:
1. Make the raster command only for one point cloud at a time
2. Show the raster after creation
3. Add a --both option to the show raster command
4. Check that the from and to rasters have the same raster cell size and spatially overlap when calling PIV

Not so Easy To-Do:
1. speed up the error propagation
2. elegantly handle missing pixels. right now they are set to 0, but this distorts the correlation and generates false results on edges.
3. check how the correlation field produced by match_template, which uses a Fourier transform, compares to the field produced by standard spatial correlation
4. check ratio of highest to second highest correlation peak as a measure of solution strength

Notes:
1. Numpy nan values produce nan correlation (skimage match_template) results.
