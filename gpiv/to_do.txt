Easy To-Do:
1. check that the 'from' and 'to' rasters have the same cell size and spatially overlap when calling PIV
2. store rastered point cloud images and json output in folder separate from code

Not so Easy To-Do:
1. speed up the error propagation
2. elegantly handle missing pixels. right now they are set to 0, but this distorts the correlation and generates false results near data boundaries.
3. check how the correlation field produced by match_template, which uses a Fourier transform, compares to the field produced by standard spatial correlation
4. store the ratio of highest to second highest correlation peak as a measure of solution strength
5. add ability to define a processing boundary

Notes:
1. Numpy nan values produce nan correlation (skimage match_template) results.
